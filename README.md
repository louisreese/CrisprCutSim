#Stochastic Nucleotide Cleavage Simulation
Simulation of oligonucleotide cleavage by nucleases.
The simulation allows to quantify gel electrophoresis experiments, where only a fraction of the oligonucleotides is labelled with a dye.
The project compiles with GNU g++ 7.5.0 and requires the GNU Scientific Library (>2.7).
Please send me a message if you need help with this project. I do not actively maintain it.
